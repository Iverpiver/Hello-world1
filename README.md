# Hello-world1



Hello! My name is Oliver and im im from Denmark, im currently 17 yr/o!
Im at the moment a student on a busniess school in Denmark where i learn about sales, and marketing.
My dream is to start my own, and to be honest i dont really enjoy school that much, but i guess i gotta get thru.
I wanna learn to make apps beacuse there is a unlimited amount of options, aswell as i think i would be cool to do something that the rest of my friends cant keep up on :).
